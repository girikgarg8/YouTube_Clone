reportWebVitals is a function that is used to report performance metrics of a web application to various web analytics tools or dashboards. 

The reportWebVitals function takes in a callback function as a parameter, which is called every time a performance metric is collected for the web application. This callback function can then be used to send the performance data to various analytics tools or dashboards, such as Google Analytics, to analyze and monitor the performance of the application.

StrictMode is a React Developer Tool primarily used for highlighting possible problems in a web application. It activates additional deprecation checks and warnings for its child components. One of the reasons for its popularity is the fact that it provides visual feedback (warning/error messages) whenever the React guidelines and recommended practices are not followed. Just like the React Fragment, the React StrictMode Component does not render any visible UI. 

For styling the header, I will use grid to style the app. Grid basically di vides the section into 12 pieces.
